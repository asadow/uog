## Header

::: callout-note
The logo does not show on purpose. `title-block.html` contains `asadow/` in the
line below even though there is no `asadow/` directory in this project. 
When a user runs `quarto add asadow/uog` in their project, 
the `_extensions/asadow/uog/` directory is created; the logo then works for the 
user.

```
<img src="_extensions/asadow/uog/pr-logo.jpg" width="300px">
